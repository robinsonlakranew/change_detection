# Project Title: Satellite Imagery Change Detection

Project Goal:
This project is the initial step towards a broader goal of understanding the effects of deforestation and wildfires. By focusing on wildfire detection through change detection, this project aims to lay the groundwork for future research and development.

Problem Statement:
Detecting changes in land cover, using satellite imagery.

Dataset:
Due to the unavailability of open-source labelled datasets specifically tailored for wildfire detection and its long-term impacts, this project initially utilizes a publicly available change detection dataset to establish a baseline. The dataset provides labeled images that can be used to train and evaluate change detection models. 
In subsequent phases, a custom dataset will be collected to address the specific requirements of deforestation/wildfire detection and its environmental consequences.

Methodology:
The project employs the following steps:

1. Data Manipulation - Gaining expertise in handling satellite and drone imagery.
2. Experimenting with ML Algorithms - Discovering which algorithms work best for change detection for satellite images.
3. Model Architecture Enhancements - Improving model architecture by addressing common dataset challenges.
4. Selecting and Optimizing Loss Functions/Metrics - Identifying the most effective loss functions and metrics for change detection and optimizing them for this specific dataset.

Future Work:
The knowledge gained from this project will be applied to create a custom dataset focused on wildfire detection and its environmental implications. The developed model will be refined and expanded to include additional factors such as vegetation indices, weather data, and fire spread modeling.
